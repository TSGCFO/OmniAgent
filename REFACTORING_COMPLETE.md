- ✅ Enhanced memory templates for better organization
- ✅ Cross-agent learning and context sharing

### 2. **Refactored Agents**

- ✅ `src/mastra/agents/refactored/researchAgent.ts` - Optimized for network coordination
- ✅ `src/mastra/agents/refactored/emailAgent.ts` - Enhanced for professional communication
- ✅ `src/mastra/agents/refactored/codingAgent.ts` - Improved for technical assistance
- ✅ `src/mastra/agents/refactored/personalAssistant.ts` - Streamlined for life management

### 3. **Enhanced Tools**

- ✅ `src/mastra/tools/refactored/semanticStorage.ts` - Network-aware with rich metadata
- ✅ `src/mastra/tools/refactored/semanticRecall.ts` - Improved search and filtering
- ✅ All tools optimized for network usage

### 4. **Advanced Workflows**

- ✅ `src/mastra/network/simplified-workflows.ts` - Clean, working workflows
- ✅ Research, Email, and Coding workflows
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

### 5. **Network Architecture**

- ✅ `src/mastra/network/omni-network-simplified.ts` - Main network coordinator
- ✅ Intelligent agent routing
- ✅ Seamless multi-agent coordination
- ✅ Dynamic tool loading

### 6. **Updated Configuration**

- ✅ `src/mastra/index.ts` - Updated to use new network
- ✅ All imports and references updated
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase

## 🧪 Testing Suite

### Available Tests

- ✅ `npm run test:final` - Comprehensive system test
- ✅ `npm run test:refactored` - Refactored system test
- ✅ `npm run test:network` - Basic network test
- ✅ `npm run test:client` - Client integration test
- ✅ `npm run cleanup:verify` - Cleanup verification

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Basic functionality
- ✅ Agent routing
- ✅ Memory persistence
- ✅ Tool integration
- ✅ Workflow execution
- ✅ Multi-agent coordination
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Complex task processing

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### Before (Tool-based Delegation)

- Manual routing through tools
- Separate memory instances
- Limited coordination
- Tool loading through mutation
- Inconsistent quality

### After (vNext AgentNetwork)

- ✅ Automatic intelligent routing
- ✅ Unified memory system
- ✅ Seamless multi-agent coordination
- ✅ Dynamic tool loading
- ✅ Consistent high quality

## 📊 Performance Benefits

1. **Intelligence**: LLM-based routing for optimal agent selection
2. **Efficiency**: Reduced token usage and faster responses
3. **Quality**: Consistent high-quality outputs across all agents
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents and workflows
5. **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more organized codebase
6. **Memory**: Shared context and learning across agents
7. **Flexibility**: Supports both simple and complex tasks

## 🎯 System Capabilities

### Core Features

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { mastra } from './mastra';

const network = mastra.getNetwork('omni-network');
const result = await network.generate("Help me with my project", {
  memory: { resource: "user-123", thread: "project-help" }
});
```

### Complex Multi-Domain Task

```typescript
const result = await network.generate(
  "Research quantum computing, write an email about it, and create a coding project plan",
  { memory: { resource: "user-123", thread: "quantum-project" }, maxSteps: 15 }
);
```

### Workflow Usage

```typescript
const result = await network.generate(
  "Use the research workflow to analyze renewable energy trends",
  { memory: { resource: "user-123", thread: "research-analysis" }, maxSteps: 20 }
);
```
