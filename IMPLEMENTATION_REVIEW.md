# OmniAgent Implementation Review

## Summary

After a comprehensive review of your OmniAgent project, I've fixed several critical issues to align with Mastra best practices. The system is now properly implemented and ready for use.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Agent Configuration Error
**Issue**: The `agents` property doesn't exist in `AgentConfig` type.
**Solution**: Removed the `agents` property from the Agent constructor. In Mastra, agents coordinate through tools, not through direct sub-agent references.

### 2. Replaced Experimental vNext Features
**Issue**: Using experimental `NewAgentNetwork` from `@mastra/core/network/vNext`.
**Solution**: Created a standard Agent (`omniAgent`) that coordinates other agents through tools. This approach is more stable and follows current Mastra patterns.

### 3. Fixed Import Statements
**Issue**: Using `createOpenAI` instead of direct `openai` imports.
**Solution**: Updated all agent files to use `import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai"` as per Mastra documentation.

### 4. Updated Main Configuration
**Issue**: Using `vnext_networks` in Mastra configuration.
**Solution**: Updated to use standard `agents` configuration with the new `omniAgent`.

### 5. Updated Workflow Integration
**Issue**: Workflow was trying to use the experimental network.
**Solution**: Updated `assistantWorkflow` to use the standard `omniAgent` instead.

## Current Architecture

### Agents
1. **omniAgent** - Main coordinator that routes tasks to specialized agents
2. **researchAgent** - Handles research and information gathering
3. **emailAgent** - Manages email composition and communication
4. **codingAgent** - Provides coding assistance and reviews
5. **personalAssistant** - Helps with personal productivity and organization

### Workflows
1. **assistantWorkflow** - Main workflow for Slack integration
2. **researchWorkflow** - Comprehensive research with analysis
3. **emailWorkflow** - Email analysis and response generation
4. **codingWorkflow** - Code analysis and improvements

### Memory System
- Unified memory using PostgreSQL with PgVector
- Resource-scoped memory for cross-thread persistence
- Semantic recall for retrieving relevant past interactions
- Working memory templates for each agent type

## How It Works

The `omniAgent` acts as the central coordinator. It:
1. Receives user requests
2. Analyzes the task requirements
3. Routes to appropriate specialized agents or workflows through tools
4. Coordinates multi-agent tasks when needed
5. Returns comprehensive responses

Each specialized agent is exposed as a tool to the omniAgent, allowing for:
- Dynamic agent selection based on task requirements
- Multi-agent coordination for complex tasks
- Consistent memory sharing across all agents
- Proper error handling and validation

## Testing

Run the test file to verify the system:

```bash
npm run test:final
```

Or test individual components:

```bash
# Test OmniAgent
npx tsx src/test-omni-agent.ts

# Test through Mastra dev server
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:4111/agents
```

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure required variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for LLM operations
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Required for memory storage
   - Additional optional configurations for Slack, Inngest, etc.

## Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: Run the database initialization scripts:
   ```bash
   npm run db:init
   npm run db:schema
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Deploy**: The system is ready for deployment using the Inngest integration.

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Stability**: Uses stable Mastra features instead of experimental ones
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with specialized agents
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents or workflows
4. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout
5. **Memory Persistence**: Robust memory system with PostgreSQL
6. **Production Ready**: Proper error handling and logging

The OmniAgent system is now properly implemented following Mastra best practices and is ready for production use.
